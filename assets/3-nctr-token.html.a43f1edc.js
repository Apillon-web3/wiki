The platform converts it to NCTR to unlock Apillon functionalities.</p><h2 id="utility" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#utility" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Utility</h2><p>The NCTR token is designed to be a multi-purpose and widely used asset, covering a range of utility cases for platform users and community members.</p><h3 id="proof-of-adoption" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#proof-of-adoption" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Proof of Adoption</h3><p>Working towards the ultimate goal of onboarding as many users as possible to Web3, Apillon implements the \u201CProof of Adoption\u201D (PoA) concept. PoA serves as the main umbrella term for Web3 adoption through Apillon and is the platform\u2019s main motivator for decision-making between individual stages of tokenomics and business model development.</p><h3 id="governance-platform-upgrades" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#governance-platform-upgrades" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Governance &amp; Platform Upgrades</h3><p>Apillon\u2019s main objective is to evolve to become a self-governing platform, built and run by developers for developers. The governance utility of the NCTR token allows token holders to submit proposals for new services to be supported by the platform, vote on them, and co-govern the development direction of Apillon to best respond to users\u2019 needs and amplify their Web3 building experience.</p><h3 id="staking-service-discounts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#staking-service-discounts" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Staking &amp; Service Discounts</h3><p>The Apillon community, users, developers, and NCTR token holders are invited to co-govern the platform via long-term NCTR token staking. Incentivization is achieved via pricing discount on the platform service, offered to NCTR token stakers who participate in the governance process and help shape the product\u2019s future. Moreover, users staking NCTR tokens get access to premium support, expert team consulting, and other perks yet to be announced.</p><h3 id="incentives-grants" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#incentives-grants" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Incentives &amp; Grants</h3><p>To achieve awareness and engagement beyond the platform use, a portion of the NCTR token fund is reserved for user incentives and grants to support teams or individuals helping to build Web3. These include, but are not limited to, SDK Grants, Protocol Integration Grants, Bug Bounties, AOTW (App of the Week) Competition, Fair Play Staking, and more.</p><h2 id="tokenomics" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tokenomics" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Tokenomics</h2><h3 id="three-stage-economic-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#three-stage-economic-model" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Three-Stage Economic Model</h3><p>In the course of its MVP development, Apillon is set to start a three-stage tokenomics and business model release cycle that introduces new features, spanned across a maximum of 24 months.</p><ul><li>Stage 1: Staking &amp; Governance</li><li>Stage 2: Incentivization &amp; Payments</li><li>Stage 3: Value Exchange &amp; Proof of Adoption</li></ul><p>In each stage, the gathered performance data will either confirm or reject the project\u2019s predispositions and help improve the tokenomics and business model to suit the users\u2019 needs.</p><h3 id="technical-token-parameters" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-token-parameters" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Technical Token Parameters</h3><p>The $NCTR token is an ERC-20-compatible token minted on the Moonbeam Network.</p><p>Total supply: 150,000,000 NCTR</p><h3 id="apillon-tokenomics-whitepaper" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#apillon-tokenomics-whitepaper" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Apillon Tokenomics Whitepaper</h3><p>Read more about the NCTR token, its role in the Apillon business model, and the general tokenomics.</p>',25),h={href:"https://apillon.io/files/Apillon_Tokenomics_Whitepaper.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},c=s("Apillon Tokenomics Whitepaper");function m(u,f){const o=l("ExternalLinkIcon");return n(),a("div",null,[p,e("p",null,[e("a",h,[c,i(o)])])])}const k=t(d,[["render",m],["__file","3-nctr-token.html.vue"]]);export{k as default};
